        <h2>About Sidecart</h2>
        <p>
SidecarT is a state-of-the-art cartridge ROM emulator crafted for the Atari ST, STE, and Mega series. It leverages the robust capabilities of the RP2040 microcontroller found in the Raspberry Pi Pico, enabling it to:
<ul>
    <li>Emulate both 64Kbyte and 128Kbyte ROMs by simply loading the binary files from a microSD card or via a Wi-Fi connection.</li>
    <li>Interact with the cartridge bus in real-time for data reading and writing, which allows for seamless emulation of devices such as hard disks, floppy disks, real-time clocks, keyboards, mouse devices, and more.</li>
    <li>Dive into a realm of possibilities, limited only by your creativity. Thanks to its open architecture and the open-source code available <a href="https://github.com/diegoparrilla/atarist-sidecart-raspberry-pico">here</a>, SidecarT can evolve to meet any challenge you envision.</li>            
</ul>

    <!-- How It Works Section -->
    <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
Getting started with SidecarT is straightforward and intuitive. Here's a step-by-step guide:
<ol>
<li><b>Load Up Your ROMs:</b> Begin by transferring the ROM binary files you wish to emulate onto a microSD card.</li>
<li><b>Setup the Hardware:</b> Ensure that the Atari ST computer is powered off. Insert the SidecarT device into the Atari ST's lateral cartridge interface.</li>
<li><b>Initiate SidecarT:</b> Power on the Atari ST. As you do, hold down the SELECT button on the SidecarT. Once the computer is on, release the button.</li>
<li><b>Choose Your Functionality:</b> You'll have an option to select the function of the SidecarT device. If you're looking to emulate a ROM, choose the "ROM Emulator" function, and then select the desired ROM binary from the list.</li>
<li><b>Start the Emulation:</b> Either reset your Atari ST computer or power cycle it. SidecarT will now operate as the selected emulated ROM cartridge. This behavior persists even if you switch the computer on and off. If you wish to emulate a different ROM or use another function, simply start over from the second step.</li>
<li><b>Dive In and Enjoy:</b> With everything set up, all that's left is for you to enjoy the immersive experience SidecarT offers!</li>
</ol>

    <!-- FAQs Section -->
    <section id="faq">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Decades have passed since the discontinuation of the Atari ST/STE/Mega computers. Why, then, should one consider SidecarT?</dt>
            <dd>While emulation tools like STEEM, Hatari, or platforms like MiSTer offer quick and easy software loading and configuration, they can't replicate the authentic experience of the original Atari ST systems. SidecarT bridges this gap. It offers the genuine tactile experience of retro computing while seamlessly integrating modern emulation features. With SidecarT, you're not just reminiscing about the past; you're reliving it with a touch of the present.</dd>

            <dt>Why are you open-sourcing the code?</dt>
            <dd>I think licensing the source code under the General Purpose License is the most genuine way to guarantee that the code belongs to the community, not any person or organization.</dd>

            <dt>Why are you open-sourcing the design with restrictions</dt>
            <dd>This is a maker project focused more on fun and community rather than looking for being lucrative. Hence, I don't feel comfortable with the idea of organizations or individuals prone to copy designs and commercialize them without giving any more value. If you are an individual and want to use the schematics to build your own SidecarT for you or your friends, that's fine. If you want to build it to get some bucks, honestly, I prefer to be the one to get those bucks. </dd>
