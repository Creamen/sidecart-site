        <!-- How It Works Section -->
        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Getting started with SidecarT is straightforward and intuitive. Here's a step-by-step guide:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Load Up Your ROMs:</b> Begin by transferring the ROM binary files you wish to emulate onto a
                    microSD card.</li>
                <li><b>Setup the Hardware:</b> Ensure that the Atari ST computer is powered off. Insert the SidecarT
                    device into the Atari ST's lateral cartridge interface.</li>
                <li><b>Initiate SidecarT:</b> Power on the Atari ST. As you do, hold down the SELECT button on the
                    SidecarT. Once the computer is on, release the button.</li>
                <li><b>Choose Your Functionality:</b> You'll have an option to select the function of the SidecarT
                    device. If you're looking to emulate a ROM, choose the "ROM Emulator" function, and then select the
                    desired ROM binary from the list.</li>
                <li><b>Start the Emulation:</b> Either reset your Atari ST computer or power cycle it. SidecarT will now
                    operate as the selected emulated ROM cartridge. This behavior persists even if you switch the
                    computer on and off. If you wish to emulate a different ROM or use another function, simply start
                    over from the second step.</li>
                <li><b>Dive In and Enjoy:</b> With everything set up, all that's left is for you to enjoy the immersive
                    experience SidecarT offers!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Decades have passed since the discontinuation of the Atari ST/STE/Mega computers. Why, then, should
                    one consider SidecarT?</dt>
                <dd>While emulation tools like STEEM, Hatari, or platforms like MiSTer offer quick and easy software
                    loading and configuration, they can't replicate the authentic experience of the original Atari ST
                    systems. SidecarT bridges this gap. It offers the genuine tactile experience of retro computing
                    while seamlessly integrating modern emulation features. With SidecarT, you're not just reminiscing
                    about the past; you're reliving it with a touch of the present.</dd>

                <dt>Why are you open-sourcing the code?</dt>
                <dd>Adopting the General Purpose License for the source code is my way of ensuring that the benefits
                    belong to the community at large, rather than being held by a particular individual or entity.</dd>
                </dd>

                <dt>Why are you open-sourcing the design with restrictions?</dt>
                <dd>The essence of this project lies in community involvement and sheer passion, not profit-making. It's
                    disheartening to envision entities or individuals merely reproducing the design for commercial gains
                    without adding any substantial value. While I'm completely supportive of enthusiasts creating their
                    own SidecarT for personal use or for fellow aficionados, those aiming for monetary benefits should
                    recognize the efforts and intentions behind this initiative. If profits are to be made, they should
                    rightfully support the original creator.</dd>

                <dt>Can I contribute to the project?</dt>
                <dd>Of course! Please visit the <a href="/programming.html">Programming</a> page to learn how to start
                    contributing to the project! No matter if you are a microcontroller ninja, an Atari ST guru, or a C
                    aficionado. You are welcome!</dd>
